"""Unit tests for PlaywrightExtractor.

This module tests the PlaywrightExtractor class to ensure:
- It correctly extracts body text from article elements
- It falls back to other selectors when article is not found
- It handles timeouts correctly
- It handles short/empty body text correctly
- It properly manages browser lifecycle via async context manager
